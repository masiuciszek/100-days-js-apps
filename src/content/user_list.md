  Users list
</a>

React Typescript app, using the Json <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/" target="_blank"> placeholder </a> where you can do GET, POST , PUT , PATCH and DELETE request on their endpoint.
This app was a way for me to find a good structure of building a React app with Context API and Typescript. Thinking how Redux works but not to install to many third-part dependencies.
